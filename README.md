# Refactoring - Imporving the Design of Existing Code

## What is Refactoring?

- "Is a processo of improving the design of existing code (without changing its bhavior)" (Martin Fowler 2003);

-  if we can idenfity design problems in the code an safe transformations, then we can imporve our code a little bit at time;
- One ofe the defining aspects of Refactoring is the focus on safe transformations;
- Refactoring is a step-=by-step processo and the steps are smaller than people typically espect. Most refactorings tend to take a minute to an hour to apply. The average is probably five to ten minutes, teh steps are even smaller. Refactoring works in tiny steps;
- Refactoring has the goal of "imporve the design of existing code";

## What is not Refactoring?

- Refactoring is not the change to add new features into the code;
- While Refactoring can be part of the process used to create new code, it is not the parte that add new features;
- TDD which consists of Test-First Programming technique to introduce new featires, followed by Refactoring to improve the Design;
- Some peple misunderstand Refactoring to be an re-structuring intended to improve code. 
- What distinguish the defnition of Refactoring from this is the idea of theat Refactoring strives to be safe transformations - refactoring canÂ´t leaves the code not working;
- ALso, refacoring is not changes in the code to fix bugs - the processo of fix bugs is inside of TDD Cycle to create a teste that will fail showing the bug in the code and then change tyhe code to make the test to pass;
